# GigaWidgets

This project allows simple widget-based construction and rendering of a GUI on an Arduino Giga with an attached Giga Display Shield.
It could easily be extended to other displays, but the first and foremost target is the aforementioned.

This project is a WIP and is not currently stable enough for use in other projects.
